# Figures Directory

This directory contains figures and visualizations for the Statistical Structure of Charge Disorder in Si/SiGe Quantum Dots project.

## Contents

### `cartoon.png`
Visualization of the quantum dot structure showing:
- Double quantum dot potential landscape
- Metallic gates (plunger and barrier)
- Charge defects at the interface
- 3D potential representation

This figure illustrates the physical system studied in the paper and helps visualize the disorder effects on quantum dot parameters.
