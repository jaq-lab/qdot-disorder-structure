# Statistical-Structure-of-Charge-Disorder-in-Si-SiGe-Quantum-Dots
Simulation data and analysis scripts for studying device variability in Si/SiGe quantum dots. Uses PCA to find principal disorder modes and assesses system controllability.

For covariance matrix see cov_matrix folder.  

The code will follow soon.
